  | Advantages of Node.js                                                                                                                                                                                    | Disadvantages of Node.js                                                                                                                                                                  |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | 1. **High Performance**: Utilizes non-blocking, event-driven architecture which makes it highly scalable and efficient for I/O-bound operations.                                                         | 1. **Single-threaded**: Being single-threaded can sometimes lead to blocking the event loop, causing performance issues for CPU-bound tasks.                                              |
  | 2. **Vibrant Ecosystem**: Large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available through npm (Node Package Manager), which makes development faster and easier.                                           | 2. **Callback Hell**: Nesting of callbacks can make the code harder to read and maintain, leading to what's known as "callback hell".                                                     |
  | 3. **JavaScript Everywhere**: Allows developers to use JavaScript on both the client-side and server-side, which can streamline development and maintenance.                                             | 3. **Unstable APIs**: Some APIs in Node.js are not backward compatible, which can cause issues when upgrading Node.js versions.                                                           |
  | 4. **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale applications with ease due to its asynchronous and event-driven nature.                                                                               | 4. **Lack of Maturity**: Despite its popularity, Node.js is relatively young compared to other server-side technologies, leading to occasional stability and maturity concerns.           |
  | 5. **Community Support**: Large and active community providing ample resources, tutorials, and support for developers.                                                                                   | 5. **Concurrency Limitations**: Limited by the number of threads it can create, which can be a bottleneck for CPU-intensive tasks.                                                        |
  | 6. **Real-time Applications**: Ideal for building real-time applications like chat applications, online gaming, and collaboration tools due to its ability to handle concurrent connections efficiently. | 6. **Security Concerns**: Being highly asynchronous, Node.js can introduce security vulnerabilities if not handled properly, such as callback injections and event loop blocking attacks. |
  | 7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on various platforms such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing flexibility in deployment.                                                                   | 7. **Debugging Complexity**: Debugging asynchronous code can be challenging, requiring specialized tools and techniques.                                                                  |
  | 8. **Microservices Architecture**: Well-suited for microservices architecture, allowing developers to create modular and scalable applications.                                                          | 8. **Learning Curve**: Requires developers to have a solid understanding of asynchronous programming and event-driven architecture, which can have a steep learning curve for some.       |
